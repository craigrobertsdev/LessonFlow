# Term Planner

The Term Planner represents the overall structure of the term with regard to the individual topics that will be taught that term.

The Term Planner will allow teachers to:
* Define the topics to be covered in the term as described by Conceptual Organisers in the domain model.
* Assign supporting Content Descriptors to each topic.
* Track a list of which Conceptual Organisers and Content Descriptors have been covered.
* Share their Term Planner with other teachers and with line managers for review and feedback.
* Printed for offline use.
* Modify if plans change during the term.

The Term Planner should be presented as a table with each row representing a week of the term each column representing a day of the week.
When planning, the teacher can select a range of cells in the table and assign a Conceptual Organiser to that range, as well as any supporting Content Descriptors.

The Term Planner will colour code the subjects with the ability to filter by subject, Conceptual Organiser, or Content Descriptor, and have those indicators create horizontal bars across the columns to show where topics are being covered.

There will be no limit to the number of Conceptual Organisers or Content Descriptors that can be assigned to a given time period.


## Conceptual understandings

Get AI to summarise the paragraph into a heading. This will be the heading used in the year planner. The conceptual understanding itself will be subtext to provide context to the header. 

Example names 
2D and 3D Shapes - 3-dimensional objects can be described by their relationship with 2-dimensional shapes. 

Coordinates (year 5) or The Cartesian Plane (year 6) - Coordinate systems can be used to precisely describe locations and movements of shapes and objects in a plane or space. 


Transformations and Symmetry - Transformations provide a way to describe the ways properties change or do not change when a shape is moved in a plane or space. 

These provide the unit blocks that will exist against a term and a week in the year planner. We can do away with the term planner entirely in favour of creating a more detailed year plan that includes all the units to be covered.


## English - This needs some serious consideration

Genre writing
Spelling
Handwriting

Sentence level writing & Text level writing


Scope and Sequence for English is more important than the Conceptual understandings in the curriculum

## I think we will need to go through the curriculum and work out what to do with each individual subject - they are not all structures as clearly as maths.
