# Reports

## Features

- Generate report comments
- Aggregate grades from assessments

### Generate report comments

This feature takes notes that the teacher made about each student, along with their grades for each subject, and generates a report comment for each student.

Report comments are generated by AI based on input data.

Constraints can be added as to the length of the comment to ensure the comment fits within the space provided on the report.

### Aggregate grades from assessments

This feature takes the grades entered for each student for each assessment and aggregates them into a single grade for each subject.


Have a list of all the dispositions that appear in the South Australian curriculum so when I am writing reports I can talk about the kids in terms of the dispositions. These are typically talked about in the general comments section.
