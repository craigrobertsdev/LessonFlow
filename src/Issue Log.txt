*** AccountSetup *** 
I get an error when trying to save the accountsetup data at the end of the process to the database. Something about the key 2025 not being found in the dictionary.
Another error appears to be that neither before nor after school duties are saved

*** LessonPlanner ***
There is an error when running the app that the only subject shown is NIT but the exception suggests that the subject Mathematics is not found

*** WeekPlanner ***
when there are planned multi-period lessons after second break, the grid renders both the multi-period lesson and an extra lesson slot in the last period
When clicking on lessonplan, an exception occurs that "DayPlan not found for {date}".
