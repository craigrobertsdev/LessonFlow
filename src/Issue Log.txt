*** Login *** 
When logging in, if there is no account, app throws an unhandled exception. Should redirect to login.

*** AccountConfirmation *** 
When confirming account, user is then neither logged in or redirected to the login page.

*** AccountSetup *** 
I get an error when trying to save the accountsetup data at the end of the process to the database. Something about the key 2025 not being found in the dictionary.
Another error appears to be that neither before nor after school duties are saved

ScheduleSteps doesn't correctly match current step. There is no update between steps 1 and 2 and when I get to step 3 there is a green line to step 4 (which shouldn't be there until I get to step 4)

*** LessonPlanner ***
There is an error when running the app that the only subject shown is NIT but the exception suggests that the subject Mathematics is not found

*** WeekPlanner ***
when there are planned multi-period lessons after second break, the grid renders both the multi-period lesson and an extra lesson slot in the last period
When clicking on lessonplan, an exception occurs that "DayPlan not found for {date}".
